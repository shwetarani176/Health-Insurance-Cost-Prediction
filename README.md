# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Health insurance cost prediction using machine learning involves using statistical algorithms to analyze historical data and predict the cost of health insurance premiums for individuals based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, location, and pre-existing medical conditions. Machine learning techniques, including linear regression, are employed to build models that can learn from the data and make accurate predictions.
